# Scan QRCode

Here you will see an easy way how implements Read QRcode in your project.

I used it in my own project and when I implemented I found some plugins that won't be worked very well, so, when I finally found the good plugin I decided to documentation to help other people.

I'm not a designer, my intention here is to introduce to you how you can use this technology and to improve your skills and your project.

I used in this project too, how to do HTTP request. GET and PUT.
